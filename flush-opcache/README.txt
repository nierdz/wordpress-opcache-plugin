This plugin allows to manage Zend OPcache inside your WordPress admin dashboard.

== Description ==

This extension adds a button in admin bar to flush OPcache. It flushes only files in WordPress absolute path and supports both memory and file caching.
If this is a multisite installation, it only shows up in network admin dashboard.
There are three tabs in admin page:
* General settings: plugin settings
* Statistics: responsive dashboard about your OPcache statistics
* Cached files: list of cached files with the possibility of invalidating them
